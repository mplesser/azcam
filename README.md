# AzCam

*AzCam* is an python package used to control an observation from a scientific imaging camera. It is intended to used as an interface to multiple non-standard hardware interfaces such as camera controllers, telescopes, instruments, and temperature controllers.

It is implemented as the python package *azcam*.

## Introduction

## Installation

## Startup and configuration

Either import a configuration module such as *azcam.config_example* into an python or IPython session or use a startup script such as *start_azcam.py* to create a new *azcam* application.
